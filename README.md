# blocipedia

A stripped down wikipedia clone built while learning Rails through bloc.io.

Users exist in three types: standard, premium and admin.

Users may upgrade their account to a premium account via a Stripe subscription. Premium users may also downgrade their account to a standard one.

Users with premium accounts may mark a wiki as private so that it will only be viewable by them or an admin.
